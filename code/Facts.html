        1. Harassment is a significant issue for women exercising outdoors.
      </h2>
      <h4>
        According to a Runners World poll in 2017, 40% of women have been
        harassed while running outdoors (and it’s even higher at 58% if you’re
        under 30), while men don’t get catcalled on a run.

        2. The US is one of only eight countries in the world that does not
        provide any form of paid maternity leave by federal law.
      </h2>
      <h4>
        Maternity leave has been linked to fewer newborn and infant deaths,
        higher rates of breastfeeding, less postpartum depression and a more
        hands-on role for new fathers. And while women who have the opportunity
        of proper paid maternity leave are more likely to stay in the workforce
        and earn higher wages, the United States and seven smaller nations still
        offer no such compensation.

        3. In low-income countries, for every hundred boys who continue their
        education after high school, only fifty-five girls do the same.
      </h2>
      <h4>
        Access to education is life-changing. Sending girls to school leads to
        improved literacy, higher wages, and faster income growth. It reduces
        the chance of premarital sex, lowers the chance of early marriage,
        delays first births, and helps mothers learn about how to plan and space
        their births apart. Whilst the benefits are endless, girls around the
        world continue to face barriers to secondary and post-secondary
        education.

        4. On average, women around the world spend more than twice as many
        hours as men doing unpaid work.
      </h2>
      <h4>
        Unpaid work refers to work performed in the home, from childcare,
        cooking and cleaning, to collecting water and gathering firewood in
        communities without electricity and running water. In India, women spend
        an average of six hours a day performing unpaid work, while men spend
        only one. In the US, women spend an average of four hours a day; men
        just 2.5. There is no country where the gap is zero. Across their
        lifetimes, on average a woman will spend seven years more performing
        unpaid work than a man. Cutting women’s unpaid work from five hours a
        day to three boosts women’s participation in the workforce by
        approximately 20%. Participating in paid work is hugely significant as
        it gives women the power, independence and financial resources to
        achieve equality with their male counterparts.

        5. Survey after survey finds parents are more likely to teach their sons
        core breadwinning skills like how to build credit and invest their
        money.
      </h2>
      <h4>
        Girls, meanwhile, are more likely to be taught how to track their
        spending and budget. A GiftCards.com survey in the US found that girls
        even get less money from their parents, with boys in high school and
        elementary school receiving roughly twenty dollars more on Christmas,
        three dollars more for completing chores, and one dollar more for
        allowance.

        6. Men generally report having more financial confidence, especially
        when it comes to investing decisions.
      </h2>
      <h4>
        A recent study from UBS Global Wealth Management found that 58% of women
        leave those crucial choices up to their male partners. And that doesn’t
        seem to be changing with Gen Y or Z. Younger women between ages twenty
        and thirty-four were actually the most likely to defer to their
        significant others, at 60%.
